##Accordion Toggle
###...an Accordion Plugin for jQuery
This plugin is meant to be as bare bones as possible, for the smallest possible footprint. You can use it for whatever you like, attribute me or not.
####*Recomended usage:*

```
var triggeringElement = $('.chosen-classname');

{triggering element}.accordionToggle({
	// settings here
	...	
});

```

The markup for the basic setup is really straightforward. and is included as an example. I would think that whatever you wanted to add or change would be really easy to do, and that was my whole idea for this simple plugin.

Keeping the css as simple as possible, the only 'absolutely necessary' properties are noted within the comments of the stylesheet. The rest of the styles are simply for the look of the demo.
